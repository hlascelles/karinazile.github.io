Travelling is my most favourite thing of all - hiking in the wilderness and exploring neighbourhoods of a huge city, getting to know the local people and staring out of the window of a train in perfect silence for hours, hunting for street art and edible plants I've not seen before.

Here I want to share my favourite things around the world. I am a big city addict, so unsurprisingly my favourite cities are London, Tokyo, Mexico city, Singapore, New Delhi and New York. I've visited 40 [countries](/travel/countries/) so far with two main goals - to understand how life is different in different countries and to enjoy the amazing and unique nature of each country. I often skip must-see tourist landmarks and instead join a local running club for a run or attend a tech meetup.
