We are all equal, in a sence that we all have exactly 24 hours a day. Most of us are free to decide what to do with these hours. If you are reading this, you are probably amongst the priveledged ones who have this freedom.


Here I want to share my projects - the things that I choose to dedicate my time to. Currently my main project is to [stop plastic pollution][1] of our oceans. In my spare time I also work on the following side projects:

* [London PyTorch Meetup]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/projects/london-pytorch-meetup/) 
* ... (the description will be added soon)
