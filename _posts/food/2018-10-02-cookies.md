## Ingredients:

* 200g butter
* 150g dark brown sugar
* 100g granulated sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1 egg + 1 egg yolk
* 248 g flour
* half-teaspoon baking soda
* 215g chocolate chips


## Methods:

* Heat 150g of the butter over medium-high heat until melted. Continue cooking, swirling the pan constantly until the butter is dark golden brown and has a nutty aroma.
* Transfer the browned butter into a large bowl, stir in the remaining 50g of butter into the hot butter until completely melted, let it cool to room temperature.
* Add both sugars, salt, and vanilla to the bowl with the butter and whisk until fully incorporated.
* Add the egg and egg yolk and whisk until the mixture is smooth with no sugar lumps remaining, about 30 seconds. Let the mixture stand for 3 minutes, then whisk for 30 seconds. Repeat the process of resting and whisking 2 more times until the mixture is thick, smooth, and shiny.
* Whisk together the flour and baking soda, stir it into the batter until just combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.
* Chill the dough in the fridge for at least 2 hours.
* Scoop the dough into balls, let them warm up to room temperature.
* Preheat the oven to 190C.
* Bake the cookies 1 tray at a time for about 8 minutes, rotating the tray at half time. They should look undercooked when removed from the oven, let them cool on a cold survace.
