### Ingredients:

* 260g carrots
* 4 oranges
* 100g walnuts
* 3 eggs
* 145g vegetable oil
* 230g flour
* 4 teaspoons baking powder
* 2 teaspoons cinnamon
* 1 teaspoons ground ginger
* 230g dark muscovado sugar
* 200g full-fat cream cheese
* 50g icing sugar

### Methods:

* Preheat the oven to 180C. Grease an 18cm loose-bottomed round cake tin.
* Grate the carrots, grate zest from 2 oranges, chop walnuts.
* Lightly beat the eggs, combine with oil.
* Combine flour, baking powder and spices into a large bowl. Add the sugar, zest, walnuts and grated carrots. Stir until well combined. Add the egg mixture and stir well.
* Pour into the cake tin and bake in the oven for 45-60 minutes, until a skewer comes out clean.
* Make candied orange peels: peel 2 oranges with vegetable peeler, cut the peels into stripes, add juice of 1 orange and some dark brown sugar, simmer until caramelised.
* Make the icing: handblender cream cheese with icing sugar and a bit of freshly squized orange juice.

**Serving suggestions:** Let the cake cool completely, put icing on top and decorate with candied orange peels. Or if you are in a rush, decorate the cake with candied orange peels as it comes out of the oven and serve the icing separately.

### Ideas:

* Try adding other spices, like a teaspoon of ground nutmeg and/or ground cloves
