## Ingredients:

* 2 cups flour
* 3/4 cup sugar
* 1/2 cup oats
* 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 3/4 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon Salt
* 3 bananas
* 1/3 cup vegetable oil
* 3/4 cup chocolate chips


## Methods:

* Preheat oven to 190C.
* Mash bananas with a fork (if they are too hard to do this easily, they won't make good muffins).
* Mix bananas with sugar and oil.
* Combine flour, oats, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Add it to the batter, mix until just combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.
* Bake for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool outside the tray.
