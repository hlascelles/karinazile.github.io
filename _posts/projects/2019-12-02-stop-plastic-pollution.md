My current mission is to [stop plastic pollution][1] of our oceans. A lot of existing efforts are aimed at creating new reward programs for collecting recyclable plastic, finding creative ways to reuse or recycle plastic, developping new materials that could replace plastic and cleaning up our oceans and our beaches. I want to start by introducing waste collection systems in regions that are populated but don't currently have a functioning waste collection systems. This will not only increase the efficiency of collecting recyclable plastic, but will also facilitate the collection of non-recyclable plastic and have a wider positive effect on the environment and the people who live in it. 


I am at the very beginning of my mission. Please do get in touch if you know anyone or anything that could help to accelerate my progress! If you are wandering why a mathematician with a PhD in applications of computer science to genomics is eager to buy waste collection trucks instead of getting a job, here is [my story](/projects/my-plastic-story/).
